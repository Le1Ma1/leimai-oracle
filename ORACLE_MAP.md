- Technical Dependency: `engine/src/reporting.py`, `engine/artifacts/optimization/single/2026-03-01/summary.json`.
- Business Value: 可直接看 all-window 拖累來源（symbol/core）與拒絕原因分解，後續調參可針對瓶頸而非盲目擴參。
- Evidence: run_id `ca5803af15c945e38ef0e45ecefe02a8` has `all_window_diagnostics`.

### [x] iteration 回報新增收斂品質欄位

### [x] 因果重構已落地並重新啟動本地迭代
- Technical Dependency: `engine/src/features.py`, `engine/src/optimization.py`, `engine/src/validation.py`, `scripts/progress_monitor.py`.
- Business Value: 特徵/融合/驗證路徑已切換為因果版，監控輸出新增 `causal_contract`，避免舊 run 的 time-travel 偏差繼續污染決策。
- Evidence: test `python -m unittest engine.tests.test_causal_contract -v` 全數通過；active run `iter_r1_06529f4be8bd`; PIDs `alpha_supervisor=4704`, `iterate=19364`, `progress_monitor=18136`.

### [x] B21_3_SUPERVISOR_SYMBOL_OVERRIDE_RUNTIME
- Technical Dependency: `scripts/alpha_supervisor.py`.
- Business Value: supervisor supports explicit `--symbols` selection and derives `ENGINE_UNIVERSE_SYMBOLS` / `ENGINE_TOP_N` from that list, removing hardcoded 15-symbol override.
- Read/Write Isolation Review: Pass. Runtime orchestration only.
- Bai Ben (Minimalism) Review: Pass. Single-argument extension; no engine strategy mutation.

### [x] B21_4_BTC_PRIORITY_SWITCH_RUNTIME
- Technical Dependency: `scripts/alpha_supervisor.py`, `scripts/progress_monitor.py`, `engine/artifacts/monitor/live_status.json`.
- Business Value: execution lane switched from 4-symbol run to BTC-first single-symbol training lane to accelerate production-readiness for BTC.
- Read/Write Isolation Review: Pass. Changes are orchestration/runtime-process switching only; no frontend or strategy-code mutation in this step.

- Technical Dependency: `engine/src/main.py --mode validate`, `engine/artifacts/optimization/single/2026-03-02/*`.
- Business Value: rebuilt validation/deploy artifacts from BTC R1 summary to remove stale run mismatch and recover decision-consistent metrics.
- Read/Write Isolation Review: Pass. Backend artifact regeneration only; no UI/runtime code mutation.
- Bai Ben (Minimalism) Review: Pass. Reused existing validate-only mode without introducing new modules.

### [x] B21_6_BTC_PHASE_RUNNER_AUTOPILOT
- Technical Dependency: `scripts/btc_phase_runner.py`, `scripts/alpha_supervisor.py`, `engine/src/main.py --mode validate`.
- Business Value: added a deterministic phase orchestrator for BTC that auto-sequences `bootstrap_recovery -> bootstrap_plus -> institutional_55 -> institutional_65 -> institutional_70` using artifact-aligned validation/deploy metrics.
- Read/Write Isolation Review: Pass. Orchestration-only; no strategy core or frontend code mutation.
- Bai Ben (Minimalism) Review: Pass. Reuses existing supervisor and validate-only paths with one thin coordinator script.

### [x] 4 檔訓練模式已切換（BTC/ETH/BNB/XRP）
- Technical Dependency: `scripts/alpha_supervisor.py --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,BNBUSDT,XRPUSDT ...`, `engine/artifacts/monitor/live_status.json`.

- Evidence: active run `iter_r1_2d737fcad4b6`; monitor shows `symbols_total=1`, `tasks_total=12`, `target_deploy_symbols=1`, `target_deploy_rules=4`.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（僅後端運行時調度變更，前端與資料契約未被污染）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（復用既有監督/監控流程，僅調整符號範圍與目標門檻）。

- Technical Dependency: `scripts/alpha_supervisor.py --symbols BTCUSDT --skip-ingest --cycles 3 --max-rounds 2 --target-pass-rate 0.40 --target-deploy-symbols 1 --target-deploy-rules 2 --target-all-alpha -20.00 --target-deploy-alpha -1.00 --stable-rounds 1 --with-monitor --monitor-interval 2`, `engine/artifacts/monitor/live_status.json`.
- Business Value: 先衝可上架候選（非空 deploy pool + 正向部署品質），縮短等待時間，再銜接 institutional 門檻。
- Evidence: active run `iter_r1_afc805b2eb0b`; monitor targets updated to bootstrap profile.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（純運行時調度參數變更）。

### [x] BTC 三段式自動升壓執行器已上線
- Technical Dependency: `scripts/btc_phase_runner.py --wait-existing --monitor-interval 2 --poll-sec 20`, `engine/artifacts/logs/btc_phase_runner_*.{out,err}.log`.
- Business Value: 由系統自動判斷每階段是否達標，先求可上架穩定再升級機構門檻，避免人工盯盤與手動切參。
- Evidence: phase-runner process active (`btc_phase_runner.py`), currently waiting/handling `validate` sync before next phase launch.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（只調度流程，未污染前端與資料契約）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（沿用既有 artifacts 作判斷，無新增資料格式）。
### [x] 根網域 Ouroboros 新中樞與 410 清場完成
- Technical Dependency: `support/server.mjs`, `support/lib/seo.mjs`, `support/web/ouroboros.css`, `support/web/ouroboros.js`, `vercel.json`, `api/internal/poll-chain.mjs`.

- Evidence: local run `python -m engine.src.ingest_market` completed with resilient logs; anomalies detected; force-orders unauthorized path handled without pipeline interruption.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（純後端 ingestion，不污染前端展示層）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（只新增最小必要腳本與 workflow）。

- Evidence: query result `anomaly_events=6`, `market_liquidations=0` after runtime ingestion at `2026-03-02T19:22Z`.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（僅後端數據層與排程層）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（採用單一路徑降級策略，不引入備援服務）。

### [ ] GitHub Actions Secrets 自動寫入受 PAT 權限阻擋（待補權限或手動設置）
- Technical Dependency: GitHub REST `/actions/secrets/*`, provided fine-grained PAT.
- Business Value: 目前 PAT 對 repository secrets API 返回 `403 Resource not accessible by personal access token`，因此需補 `Actions secrets write` 權限或由你在 UI 手動新增兩個 secrets。
- Required: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

### [x] GitHub Actions Secrets 已改由高權限 PAT 自動寫入完成
- Technical Dependency: GitHub PAT (`workflow/repo/admin` scope), REST `/actions/secrets/*`.

- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（僅兩個必要 secrets）。

### [ ] ingest-market-4h 首次 dispatch 遭遇 startup_failure（平台層阻塞待解）
- Technical Dependency: GitHub Actions run `22592663863` for workflow `.github/workflows/ingest_4h.yml`.
- Business Value: dispatch 已成功送達（204），但 run 立即 `startup_failure` 且 `jobs=[]`，表示阻塞位於 GitHub Actions 平台/倉庫運行層，而非 workflow 腳本步驟邏輯。
- Evidence: run status `completed/startup_failure`, jobs endpoint returns zero jobs.
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（狀態觀測與控制平面排查）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（未新增 workaround runner 服務）。

### [x] Phase 1.2 Oracle Brain 已打通（Mock LLM to Supabase）
- Technical Dependency: `supabase/schema_reports.sql`, `engine/src/generate_reports.py`, `.github/workflows/ingest_4h.yml`.

- Evidence: realtime verification via Supabase REST: `oracle_reports=6`, processed medium events (`event_id` prefixes `1219f3fce868`, `c5af105b7746`, `76faeece61ac`).
- 讀寫分離檢查: 通過（僅後端數據層新增寫入邏輯）。
- 白賁極簡檢查: 通過（LLM 層預設 mock，保留 Gemini key 介面不強耦合）。
